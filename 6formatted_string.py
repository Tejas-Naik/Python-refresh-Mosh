# Formatted strings are used to format strings the way we want
# If you wanna print John [Smith] is a coder!
first_name = "Tejas" 
last_name = "Naik"
print(first_name + " ["+ last_name +"] is a coder")
# OMG Look at the code above do you understand that at the first glance?
# this is where the formatted strings come in Handy

print(f"{first_name} [{last_name}] is a coder")  # f for formatted
